# Push notification backend example

This is a simple example of a backend that interacts with the Expo
push API using [expo-server-sdk-ruby](https://github.com/expo/expo-server-sdk-ruby).

When you create a new app in Expo it hits this backend and it just
pushes a notification to your device. See the [Expo starter
template](http://github.com/expo/new-project-template)
for details on how to integrate with the backend on the client side.
